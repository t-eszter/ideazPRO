# University of London BSc Computer Science Final Project

This repository contains the final year project for the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science degree at the University of London. The project showcases the culmination of knowledge and skills acquired throughout the course.

## Project Overview

The evolution of traditional idea boxes, which have been utilised by companies for several decades to gather feedback and suggestions from their workforce, has led to the inception of the 'Digital Ideabox'. This concept represents a modernization of the conventional methods, leveraging digital platforms for enhanced efficiency and accessibility. My extensive research in this domain revealed the existence of several digital counterparts to the traditional idea box. However, a significant proportion of these digital solutions appeared archaic and were observed to be deficient in various critical features.
I recognized a niche in the market for a contemporary, user-centric digital suggestion system that could also incorporate advanced AI technology.
